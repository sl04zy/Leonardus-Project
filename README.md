# Leonardus-Project


Leonardus is an open-source discord bot. Anyone can use his code and maybe learn something new.



## **DISLAIMER**
I am not a professional discord developer. I code only in my spare time. If there are some errors please, don't kill me.



## Tips for installation

- Python 3.8 (or superior) required
- Packages: discord, colorama, asyncio
- Once you have satisfied all the requirements, start the init.py file.
